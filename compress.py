unknown until they appeared at the Democratic National Convention three days ago   In an interview on ABC s  This Week   Mr  Trump took issue with Khizr Khan  who had questioned whether Mr  Trump had read the U S  Constitution and said Mr  Trump had  sacrificed nothing   Mr  Trump responded by citing his hard work and business success    I ve created thousands and thousands of jobs  tens of thousands of jobs  built great structures   Mr  Trump told host George Stephanopoulos   I think they re sacrifices  I think  when I can employ thousands and thousands of people  take care of their education  take care of so many things     Mr  Trump also noted his role in helping build a Vietnam Memorial in Manhattan               Khizr Khan  whose son  Army Capt  Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in       offered biting criticism of Donald Trump at the DNC  asking  Have you even read the United States Constitution   Photo  Getty Images But the Republican nominee immediately ignited another furor by saying Mr  Khan s wife  Ghazala  had been  extremely quiet  onstage at the Democratic convention and perhaps she  wasn t allowed to have anything to say   The Khans say she was too distraught to speak about her son s      death    Even before they were aired in full on Sunday morning  the comments generated controversy  Mr  Trump s aggressive  attacking style kept him at the forefront of the news throughout the Republican primaries as he knocked off    rivals  he is now trying the same strategy with a much broader  much more diverse electorate   Responding to the criticism  Mr  Trump issued a statement late Saturday calling Capt  Humayan Khan  Khizr s son  a  hero   and saying the  real problem  is  radical Islamic terrorists     While I feel deeply for the loss of his son  Mr  Khan who has never met me  has no right to stand in front of millions of people and claim I have never read the Constitution   which is false  and say many other inaccurate things   Mr  Trump said in the statement   Mr  Khan responded emotionally to Mr  Trump again on Sunday  saying he appreciates the candidate s recognition of his son as a hero but that his ideas remain un American  Mr  Trump has called for a ban on Muslims entering the U S   or in other versions of the proposal  a ban on immigration from countries compromised by terrorism    His policies  his practices  do not reflect that he has any understanding of the basic  fundamental constitutional principles of this country  what makes this country exceptional in the history of mankind   Mr  Khan said on CNN s  State of the Union    He choked up as he responded to Mr  Trump s insinuation that his wife had to remain silent onstage  Ghazala Khan becomes overwhelmed when she sees her son s picture  which was projected in the convention hall  he said   In a column in The Washington Post on Sunday  Mrs  Khan responded to Mr  Trump s questioning why she didn t speak   Without saying a thing  all the world  all America  felt my pain   she wrote   I am a Gold Star mother  Whoever saw me felt me in their heart    She said it wasn t true that she wasn t allowed to speak at the convention  saying her husband had asked if she wanted to  but she felt overwhelmed    Walking onto the convention stage  with a huge picture of my son behind me  I could hardly control myself  What mother could   she wrote   Donald Trump has children whom he loves  Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak    Mr  Khan in his remarks on Sunday said  two things are absolutely necessarily in any leader or any person that aspires  that wishes  to be a leader  a moral compass  and second is empathy     This candidate is void of both traits that are necessary for stewardship of this country   he said in his remarks on  State of the Union    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in Cleveland that Mr  Trump was offering a divisive message    Mr  Khan paid the ultimate sacrifice in his family  didn t he   she said   And what has he heard from Donald Trump  Nothing but insults  degrading comments about Muslims  a total misunderstanding of what made our country great religious freedom  religious liberty    Mr  Khan also called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R   Ky   and House Speaker Paul Ryan  R   Wisc   to withdraw their endorsements from the Republican nominee    I address the Senate majority leader a patriot and I address the speaker of the House  patriotic American  It is their moral obligation  history will not forgive them   Mr  Khan said   This election will pass  but history will be written  The lapse of moral courage will be a burden on their souls    In a statement Sunday that didn t mention Mr  Trump  Mr  McConnell called Capt  Khan an  American hero  and called a travel ban on Muslims  simply contrary to American values    AshLee Strong  a spokeswoman for Mr  Ryan  reiterated the speaker s opposition to Mr  Trump s proposed Muslim immigration ban   The speaker has made clear many times that he rejects this idea and himself has talked about how Muslim Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country   she said   Mr  Trump responded on Twitter on Sunday morning  saying he was  viciously attacked  by Mr  Khan at the convention   Am I not allowed to respond  Hillary voted for the Iraq war  not me   he said   Mr  Trump has said he was opposed to the Iraq War when it started  but there is some evidence he supported it at the time   The discomfort of some Republicans with Mr  Trump s response was evident  Ohio Gov  John Kasich  who ran against Mr  Trump for the Republican nomination  tweeted   There s only one way to talk about Gold Star parents  with honor and respect  Capt  Khan is a hero  Together  we should pray for his family    But Sen  Jeff Sessions  R   Ala    a Trump supporter  defended the Republican nominee on  State of the Union   saying Mr  Trump hadn t spoken inappropriately   His interview was not unkind  it was respectful  it did express condolences to the family for their loss   Mr  Sessions said   Mrs  Clinton took a low key approach Sunday in responding to criticism from Pat Smith  the mother of an American killed in the      attack in Benghazi  Libya  while Mrs  Clinton was Secretary of State  who d said at the Republican convention   I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son    Mrs  Clinton responded on Fox News Sunday   I understand the grief and the incredible sense of loss   adding that she had no  ill feeling  toward Ms  Smith "
